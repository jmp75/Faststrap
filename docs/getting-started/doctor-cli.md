# Faststrap Doctor CLI

Use `faststrap doctor` to detect common setup and integration issues.

This command is intended to catch common "why is this not working?" integration problems before deployment.

## Install / entrypoint

After installing a version that includes CLI scripts:

```bash
faststrap doctor
```

## Scan custom path

```bash
faststrap doctor --path .
```

## Checks currently included

- Import source shadowing (site-packages vs local source confusion).
- Missing or outdated `python-fasthtml` dependency when a local `pyproject.toml` declares a minimum version.
- Missing `add_bootstrap(...)` call.
- Potential `/static` mount conflicts with `mount_assets(...)`.
- `toast_response(...)` usage without `ToastContainer(...)`.
- Basic preset misuse detection patterns.
- Serverless deployment issues:
  - no `use_cdn=True` in serverless environments
  - `serve(...)` calls in serverless entrypoints

## Why this helps

- Faster onboarding for new contributors.
- Reduced support/debug time for avoidable setup mistakes.
- Better consistency between local and production behavior.

## Exit behavior

- Exit `0`: no issues found.
- Exit `1`: one or more warnings detected.

## Typical workflow

1. Run `faststrap doctor`.
2. Fix reported issues.
3. Re-run until status is clean.

## Typical fix examples

- If you get a static conflict warning, move custom assets from `/static` to `/assets`.
- If you get missing toast container warning, add `ToastContainer(...)` to your base layout.
